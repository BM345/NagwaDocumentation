                <h2>A Basic Definition</h2>

                <p>A lesson scope is a document that describes what <i>is</i> and what <i>is not</i> covered by a
                    lesson.</p>

                <p>Some sections of a lesson scope will be visible to end users (mainly teachers and tutors); other
                    sections will be for internal use only.</p>

    <section class="whitesection" id="part2">
        <div class="centrecolumn">
            <div class="textcolumn">
                <h2>The Intended Audiences</h2>

                <p>Lesson scopes are intended to be seen and used by several different groups of people, and when
                    writing a lesson scope, all of these groups must be considered.</p>

                <h3>1. Teachers</h3>

                <p>Some sections of the lesson scope will be visible to teachers. The purpose of this is to inform
                    teachers what topics and skills are covered by a lesson without them having to look through all of
                    the questions. The aim is to give teachers the confidence that they are giving their students
                    material that is relevant to what they are learning in classes, and that they are <i>not</i> giving
                    their students material that is too advanced.</p>

                <p>Sections of the lesson scope that are visible to teachers should not be overly long, as this may
                    discourage teachers from reading them.</p>

                <h3>2. Video Developers</h3>

                <p>One of the purposes of the lesson scope is to inform video developers what a student must learn from
                    doing a lesson. This makes it easier to create lesson videos that are relevant to existing
                    text-based content for the lesson (questions and explainers), and it reduces the need to remake
                    lesson videos, which can take a long time.</p>

                <p>The lesson scope must make it clear to video developers what the student must know and be able to do
                    by the end of the lesson, what methods are preferred for answering certain kinds of questions, and
                    what is considered out-of-scope for a lesson because it is too advanced or requires too much
                    explanation.</p>

                <h3>3. Other Content Developers</h3>

                <p>As Nagwa content is developed over a long period of time by many different people in different
                    countries, the lesson scope for a lesson serves as a way of recording what the limits of a lesson
                    are and why. When lots of people edit the content of a lesson, it's easy for additional skills to be
                    included in a lesson, making the lesson more difficult for students, or possibly making the lesson
                    no longer suitable for a particular alignment.</p>

                <p>The lesson scope serves as a way of recording what decisions have been made for a certain lesson and
                    why - why certain topics or skills have been excluded. They can also include recommendations for how
                    other types of content (such as explainers or lesson videos) should be approached.</p>

        <div class="centrecolumn">
            <div class="textcolumn">
                <h2>The Sections of a Lesson Scope</h2>

                <p>Some of the sections of a lesson scope will be viewable by end users; other sections will only be
                    viewable by content and video developers. Some sections are required; other sections are optional.
                </p>

                <h3>The List of Objectives</h3>

                <p>This section of the lesson scope describes what students are expected to have learnt by doing this
                    lesson. This section should be a list of skills, where the wording of each skill is such that it
                    completes the sentence 'The student should be able to'.</p>

                <p>The skills need to be written in a way that is clear and specific, but without being overly long.</p>

                <p>This section is <b>required</b> and <b>viewable to end users</b>.</p>

                <h3>The List of Prerequisites</h3>

                <p>This section describes what skills a student must already be able to do before attempting this
                    lesson. These are skills that are depended on in order to answer the questions, but which will not
                    be specifically taught in the lesson.</p>

                <p>This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Prerequisites that are considered trivial are not
                    included - for example, in a lesson about using the Doppler Effect to find the period of an
                    exoplanet, technically a prerequisite of this is to be able to add two single digit numbers under
                    ten, but given the g-value of such a lesson, this prerequisite is considered to be trivial and so
                    not included, like many thousands of similar basic maths skills.</p>

                <p>Instead, this list is intended to give teachers an idea of what skills or topics need to be covered
                    before they give this lesson to their students. If there's a reasonable chance that a teacher might
                    not know that a certain skill needs to have been covered, then that skill can go in this list.</p>

                <p>This list is also very useful for video developers, as it tells them what they can assume that a
                    student already knows.</p>

                <p>This section is <b>optional</b> and <b>viewable to end users</b>.</p>

                <h3>The List of Exclusions</h3>

                <p>This section describes what skills and topics are specifically <b>not</b> covered by the lesson.</p>

                <p>This section is very useful for video developers, as it tells them what topics to avoid mentioning.
                    This section also gives teachers the confidence that they are not giving their students something
                    that they haven't covered or won't need to cover.</p>

                <p>Again, this list isn't supposed to be <i>exhaustive</i>. There are thousands of skills and topics
                    that are not included in any one lesson, but most of them don't need to be pointed out. This list
                    should contain skills and topics that a teacher might think are in the lesson based on its title and
                    g-value, but which aren't.</p>

                <p>This section is <b>optional</b> and <b>viewable to end users</b>.</p>

                <h3>The Notes for Developers</h3>

                <p>This section is for anything and everything else that is useful to record for the development of a
                    lesson. This section is for <b>internal use only</b>, so anything that is useful for other content
                    and video developers to know can go here:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>recommended questions to use as examples</li>
                    <li>preferred methods to use when solving questions</li>
                    <li>terms and phrases to avoid using in explanations</li>
                    <li>and anything else</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Sections that may be added in future</h2>

                <p>At the moment, the only three sections of the lesson scope that are visible to end users are the
                    objectives, the prerequisites, and the exclusions, and only the objectives are a required section.
                    In future, however, more sections may be added to give more information to teachers about what's in
                    the lesson. Listed below are some of the sections that may be added - much of this information may
                    already be included in the 'Notes for Developers' section.</p>

                <h3>New Terminology</h3>

                <p>This section would contain terms that are introduced in this lesson, and which students are not
                    expected to know the meaning of beforehand. The meaning of these terms would generally be explained
                    in the lesson video and explainer. (This explanation of the term may or may not be a formal
                    definition, depending on the g-value of the lesson, style of the content being produced, subject,
                    topic, and the extent to which the word has a strict, formal definition.)</p>

                <h2>What a lesson scope is <b>not</b></h2>

                <p>A lesson scope / lesson plan as used in the development of Nagwa content is <b>not</b> a list or
                    timetable of activities for a teacher to do in a class with their students (which is what the phrase
                    'lesson plan' is normally used to mean). A lesson scope exists to record what the <i>limits</i> of a
                    lesson are. They are a detailed, consistent way of recording what each lesson is supposed to be
                    about.</p>
