                <h2>What is a skill?</h2>

                <p>In simple terms, a skill is either:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a piece of information that the student must <i>know</i> and be <i>able to recall</i></li>
                    <li>or a technique - something that the student is <i>able to do</i> as part of answering a question</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In other words, a student has learned a skill if they <i>know a fact</i> or <i>know how to do something</i>.</p>

                <p>Here are some examples of skills:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>know that the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066</li>
                    <li>know what the circuit symbol for a resistor is</li>
                    <li>know the names of the elements that are in group one of the periodic table</li>
                    <li>be able to add two single digit numbers</li>
                    <li>be able to use the formula <i>I</i> = <i>Q</i>/<i>t</i> to find the current in a circuit, where <i>Q</i> is the charge that moves past a point in the circuit in a time <i>t</i></li>
                    <li>be able to label the chambers of the heart on a diagram of the human heart</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why do we use 'skills'?</h2>

                <p>Skills are a convenient, consistent way of describing what a student should have learned by doing a lesson. They are also useful for describing what a student needs to know or be able to do before starting a particular lesson.</p>  

                 <p>
                     They are also useful on a question level. By listing the skills that a particular question tests or teaches, it becomes easy to see what the <i>purpose</i> of a question within a lesson is, and what makes that question different to other, perhaps similar, questions in the lesson.

           <h2>How to write skills</h2>

           <p>Skills are used in lesson plans, and because of this, a skill should be able to follow on from the phrase 'By the end of this lesson, the student should' - i.e., the skill should complete that sentence.</p>

           <ul>
               <li>A skill should start with a verb or verb phrase, such as
                   <ul>
                       <li>know</li>
                       <li>understand</li>
                       <li>be able to describe</li>
                       <li>be able to draw</li>
                       <li>be able to interpret</li>
                       <li>be able to calculate</li>
                       <li>...</li>
                   </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                   Since a skill should complete the above sentence, it shouldn't start with a capital letter.
               </li>
           </ul>

                  <h2>Specificity vs. Simplicity</h2>

                  <p>
                      One of the tricky things about writing skills is how <i>specific</i> they should be versus how easy they are to read.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      The list of skills for a lesson will be seen by video developers and other content developers, so it's important for the skills to be specific so that those people have a very clear idea of what is and isn't meant to be in the lesson.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      However, being more specific often involves using more words. The list of skills covered by a lesson will also be seen by teachers using the Nagwa platform. If the list of skills is overly-wordy, this may discourage teachers from reading through the list.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      So skills need to be written in a way that is sufficiently clear for everyone who's going to read them, but which doesn't over-explain them. This can be a difficult balance to get right.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Consider the following example skill:
                  </p>      
                  <ul>
                      <li>know the symbols for all of the leptons</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>(A lepton is a type of fundamental particle.) This skill could be made more specific by explicitly stating each type of lepton:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>know the symbol for the electron</li>
                      <li>know the symbol for the muon</li>
                      <li>know the symbol for the tauon</li>
                      <li>know the symbol for the electron neutrino</li>
                      <li>know the symbol for the mu neutrino</li>
                      <li>know the symbol for the tau neutrino</li>
                      </ul>       
                      <p>
                          But this is an example of being <b>too specific</b>. Any video developer or teacher will know that these are the six types of leptons, and so it is not necessary to be this specific.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          But this skill could also have been written in a way that's <b>too vague</b>. For example:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>know all of the leptons</li></ul>
                        <p>
                            This is unclear. Know <i>what</i> about the leptons? A teacher reading this might think that the student also has to know the mass, charge, and spin of all of the leptons, which is not what was meant.
                        </p>
