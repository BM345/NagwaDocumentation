                <h2>What is a skill?</h2>

                <p>
                    In simple terms, a skill is either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a piece of information that the student must <i>know</i> and be <i>able to recall</i></li>
                    <li>or a technique - something that the student is <i>able to do</i> as part of answering a question
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In other words, a student has learned a skill if they <i>know a fact</i> or <i>know how to do
                        something</i>.</p>
                <p>
                    Here are some examples of skills:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>know that the Battle of Hastings took place in 1066</li>
                    <li>know what the circuit symbol for a resistor is</li>
                    <li>know the names of the elements that are in group one of the periodic table</li>
                    <li>be able to add two single digit numbers</li>
                    <li>be able to use the formula <i>I</i> = <i>Q</i>/<i>t</i> to find the current in a circuit, where
                        <i>Q</i> is the charge that moves past a point in the circuit in a time <i>t</i></li>
                    <li>be able to label the chambers of the heart on a diagram of the human heart</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why do we use 'skills'?</h2>
                <p>
                    Skills are a convenient, consistent way of describing what a student should have learned by doing a
                    lesson. They are also useful for describing what a student needs to know or be able to do before
                    starting a particular lesson.</p>
                <p>
                    They are also useful on a question level. By listing the skills that a particular question tests or
                    teaches, it becomes easy to see what the <i>purpose</i> of a question within a lesson is, and what
                    makes that question different to other, perhaps similar, questions in the lesson.

                <h2>How to write skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Skills are used in lesson plans, and because of this, a skill should be able to follow on from the
                    phrase 'By the end of this lesson, the student should' - i.e., the skill should complete that
                    sentence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A skill should start with a verb or verb phrase, such as
                        <ul>
                            <li>know</li>
                            <li>understand</li>
                            <li>be able to describe</li>
                            <li>be able to draw</li>
                            <li>be able to interpret</li>
                            <li>be able to calculate</li>
                            <li>...</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since a skill should complete the above sentence, it shouldn't start with a capital letter.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Specificity vs. Simplicity</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the tricky things about writing skills is how <i>specific</i> they should be versus how easy
                    they are to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of skills for a lesson will be seen by video developers and other content developers, so
                    it's important for the skills to be specific so that those people have a very clear idea of what is
                    and isn't meant to be in the lesson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, being more specific often involves using more words. The list of skills covered by a lesson
                    will also be seen by teachers using the Nagwa platform. If the list of skills is overly-wordy, this
                    may discourage teachers from reading through the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So skills need to be written in a way that is sufficiently clear for everyone who's going to read
                    them, but which doesn't over-explain them. This can be a difficult balance to get right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the following example skill:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>know the symbols for all of the leptons</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(A lepton is a type of fundamental particle.) This skill could be made more specific by explicitly
                    stating each type of lepton:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>know the symbol for the electron</li>
                    <li>know the symbol for the muon</li>
                    <li>know the symbol for the tauon</li>
                    <li>know the symbol for the electron neutrino</li>
                    <li>know the symbol for the mu neutrino</li>
                    <li>know the symbol for the tau neutrino</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But this is an example of being <b>too specific</b>. Any physics video developer or physics teacher
                    will know that these are the six types of leptons, and so it is not necessary to be this specific.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this skill could also have been written in a way that's <b>too vague</b>. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>know all of the leptons</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is unclear. Know <i>what</i> about the leptons? A teacher reading this might think that the
                    student also has to know the mass, charge, and spin of all of the leptons, which is not what was
                    meant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem becomes particularly apparent when using words like 'understand', 'describe', and
                    'identify'. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>understand Pythagoras' Theorem</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What on earth does this mean? The problem is that there are multiple levels of understanding that
                    this could refer to. It could mean anything from 'know how to use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the
                    hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle' to 'know how to derive Pythagoras' Theorem for any space with
                    any number of dimensions'.</p>
                <p>
                    The solution to this is just trying to imagine 'Will a video developer understand what is meant by
                    this?', 'Will a teacher understand what is meant by this?'. If there's a reasonable chance that they
                    might not, then the skill probably needs to be more specific.
                </p>

                <h2>The meaning of different verbs and verb phrases</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the words we use in writing skills are a bit ambiguous. For example, what really is the
                    difference between 'know' and 'understand'? Is there any difference between the following two
                    skills?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>know what baryon number is</li>
                    <li>understand what baryon number is</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The nature of language means that the words 'know' and 'understand' will always be somewhat
                    interchangeable. And for any given skill, there may or may not be a right answer for which one is
                    better. But in general, here is what the different verbs and verb phrases are taken to mean, and how
                    they are used:
                </p>
            </div>

                    <td>generally used for skills that are about knowing facts, rather than knowing how to use
                        particular methods or techniques, or understanding processes</td>

                        have to give the written description themselves as part of an FRQ, or choose which of several
                        statements best describes something, or choose which word fills in the blank in a statement</td>

                        from a list or set of similar things, be able to name processes or objects based on a
                        description, et c.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                        though our questions can't test them on that) and also recognise correct and incorrect drawings
                        of that something (which is what we test them on in our questions)</td>
